errors_in Snare Drum_Annotation_repaired

issue: in original annotation Some snare drums are annotated but not heard in real recordings  

So in dir accompaniment_all_drummers the .txt files are edited manually by me. 
The wrong ts are thrown away. 

Edited files: 

drummer_3_134_minus-one_bossa_sticks
drummer_2_115_minus-one_salsa_sticks _ TODO. only sent in email to olivier

drummer_3_126_minus-one_salsa_sticks - TODO

drummer_3_131_minus-one - many snare 1-second rolls are falsely annotated. not to be heard.  
drummer_2_120_minus-one_funk_sticks - some snare 1-seond rolls ---||---
